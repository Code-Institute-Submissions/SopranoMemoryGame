## Overview

For this milestone project, I wanted to create an interactive card matching game inspired by my favourite TV show, The Sopranos.
The game will be simple, to match the 20 character cards.
The game will also feature an interactive music player that will have the opening theme song of the show as an option to play/pause.

Developed and designed as part of Milestone Project 2: Interactive Frontend Development for Code Institute.

# Design

## Colour Scheme

- It's important for the site to follow the the color scheme from the show in order to create a feel that the game is inspired by the TV Show.
- The three main colours of the TV show are black, white and red. The title **The Sopranos** is shown in a white or red colour depending on the source. I have decided to go for the white colour as its the most common.

For the background, the colour will be black.

Each card will be blended into the black background, as the back of the card which will display the main title, will represent each card. Like this:

## Fonts

For the character checklist, I decided to use Big Shoulder Stencil from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) as I felt it was a close match to the main title.



## Audio

The site will have the intro song added to the game.
It will include the song, **_Woke Up This Morning by Alabama 3_**

## Imagery

The cards for the game will hold characters from the TV show. I have selected 20 characters from the show as the front of the card.
