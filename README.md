## Overview

For this milestone project, I wanted to create an interactive memory game inspired by my favourite TV show, The Sopranos.
The game will be simple, match the character cards until none are left as quickly as possilbe for a highscore. The game will have 3 difficulties; easy, medium and hard with each difficulty having more cards.


Developed and designed as part of Milestone Project 2: Interactive Frontend Development for Code Institute

## Design 
 - Colour Scheme

 It's important for the game/site to follow the the color scheme from the show in order to create a feel that the game is inspired by the TV Show.
 The colour scheme will follow the theme of the TV show. The three main colours of the TV show are black, white and red. The title 'The Sopranos' is shown in a white or red colour depending on the source. I have decided to go for the white colour to keep the site simple. 

 For the background, the colour will be black 
 
 It's very important that the colour scheme of the game has the same feel of the TV show. The site will consist of one page


- Fonts
As the site won't hold much text, the only text of the site will be of the main title, **The Sopranos**.
I have used [Font Meme] (https://fontmeme.com/sopranos-font/) to generate the text and implement it to the site.  


- Audio 
The site will have the intro song added to the game. 
It will include the song, *Woke Up This Morning by Alabama 3*.


- Imagery
The images of the game will be characters from the TV show. 
All character images are from [HBO Cast & Crew] (https://www.hbo.com/the-sopranos/cast-and-crew)
